## Workshop in Winter 2026

The primary goals of this workshop include:

* Providing a friendly environment for students and other researchers to present their work.
* Strengthening ties between local institutions.
* Learning about cool things happenings in programming languages, systems, and related areas!

## Submission Guidelines

Both original research and work that has been published in other venues is welcome!

Selected abstracts will be presented as a talk or a poster. The program committee will determine the
length of the talks based on the number and content of the abstracts; and they'll provide more
information when they notify you of acceptance.

## Commuting and Parking

If you are traveling to Los Angeles by train, the easiest way to get from Union Station to USC is to
take the southbound A-line (blue) train to the 7th Street Metro Center, and then switch to the
westbound E-line (yellow) train to Expo Park / USC station. From there, Ginsburg Hall is a short
[10-minute walk across campus](https://maps.app.goo.gl/snFEdL76iN73e2xF6). Google predicts the
entire commute to take about 40 minutes from [Union Station to Ginsburg
Hall](https://maps.app.goo.gl/UiHiubpTdTBoAPry7).

If you are driving to campus, you can park at the Downey Way Parking Structure, right across the
street from Ginsburg Hall. Daily parking costs $20.50, and you can [pay by
phone](https://transnet.usc.edu/index.php/daily-and-hourly-parking/).
