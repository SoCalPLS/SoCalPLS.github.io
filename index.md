## Commuting and Parking

If you are traveling to Los Angeles by train, the easiest way to get from Union Station to USC is to
take the southbound A-line (blue) train to the 7th Street Metro Center, and then switch to the
westbound E-line (yellow) train to Expo Park / USC station. From there, Ginsburg Hall is a short
(10-minute walk across campus)[https://maps.app.goo.gl/snFEdL76iN73e2xF6]. Google predicts the
entire commute to take about 40 minutes from (Union Station to Ginsburg
Hall)[https://maps.app.goo.gl/UiHiubpTdTBoAPry7].

If you are driving to campus, you can park at the Downey Way Parking Structure, right across the
street from Ginsburg Hall. Daily parking costs $20.50, and you can (pay by
phone)[https://transnet.usc.edu/index.php/daily-and-hourly-parking/].
