## Workshop in Winter 2025

The primary goals of this workshop include:

* Providing a friendly environment for students and other researchers to present
  their work.
* Strengthening ties between local institutions.
* Learning about cool things happenings in programming languages, systems, and related areas!

## Submission Guidelines

Both original research and work that has been published in other venues is welcome!

Selected abstracts will be presented as a talk or a poster. The program
committee will determine the length of the talks based on the number and content
of the abstracts; and they'll provide more information when they notify you of
acceptance.

## Driving Directions and Parking

Campus parking is very limited and is not recommended. You can check available options here. The closest parking lot for visitors is located on the top floor of [Hopkins Parking Structure](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Hopkins+Parking/@32.8837791,-117.2419775,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x80dc06c1e6156103:0xc6690b999c002d97!8m2!3d32.8837791!4d-117.2394026!16s%2Fg%2F1jky0r__3?entry=tts). You can pay the fee in pay station or pay-by-phone. Note that most visitor spots are limited to two hours. Even though the app allows you to pay for longer periods, you will get a ticket after that time.
